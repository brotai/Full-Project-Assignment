# Issues present
~~~md
- footer alignment issues still present.
- modal presents an overflow issue. Couldn't find the direct cause.

# Changes
~~~md
- js-demo.html - modal overflowing on the x axis fixed mostly.

- forms.html - added closing tags on google forms so it displays. 

- my-research.html - fully completed.

- index.html - The back of all flipboxes have been formatted properly now.

- Collapse and the Accordion classes are working properly.
-----------------------------------------
- js-demo-html - more spacing added to the open cart parent element (It overlapped with the clear cart button on small screens).

- Removed p-0 m-0 classes from the parent div nested under main/section buttons. They were causing some x overflow issues
